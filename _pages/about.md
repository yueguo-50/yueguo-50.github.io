I am a final year Ph.D. student in Biomedical and Health Informatics Department (BIME) at the [University of Washignton](https://bime.uw.edu), advised by Prof. Trevor Cohen. 

I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/radiology), with Todd McNutt. I received my Master degree from the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu), majoring in cancer Epidemiology and Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S) degree (equivalent to M.D.) from Capital Medical University.

I am particularly interested in enhancing the accessibility and personalization of health information by NLP methodologies.
