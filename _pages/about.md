Assistant Professor @ UIUC. Previously: [UW](https://bime.uw.edu)/[AI2](https://www.semanticscholar.org)/[Google](https://research.youtube/)/[MSR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/empowermd/)/[JHU](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/radiology).

I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Information Sciences (iSchool)](https://ischool.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbanaâ€“Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/), with an affiliated faculty position in the [Department of Computer Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/).

I earned my Ph.D. in Health Informatics from the [University of Washington](https://bime.uw.edu), working under the mentorship of Trevor Cohen. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/radiology). I hold a Master's degree in Epidemiology from the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu) and an M.B.B.S. degree (equivalent to an M.D.) from Capital Medical University.

My research broadly focuses on **natural language processing** in the medical domain, with a particular interest in enhancing the accessibility and personalization of health information through NLP methodologies.
